# Stock-Analysis
Analysis on green stock performance 
## Overview of Project
In this project data and VBA code were used to help create an efficient way to look at and analyze past and current performance of various stocks.  
## Results
Upon completing the analysis we are able to see that a majority of the stocks seen in 2018 yielded significantly lower returns, and in most cases lost value when compared to their performance in 2017. When executing commands with refactored code there was a substantial boost in performance observed when compared to the original VBA script. 
### Summary 
* like everything in life there are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. When considering the advantages such as; better performance, faster results, simplifying strings of code, it is also important to consider some of the disadvantages to refactoring such as; the amount of time that it takes, the potential budget constraints in a project might not allow for refactoring, and also the size of the application. 
* This particular project benefited from refactored code because it allowed the program to run significantly faster and allowed it to process more data more efficiently. This translates to real world results when comparing various stocks because the number of stocks being compared can be increased without having to worry as much about the time it takes to process all of the stocks.
